"8961739","2015-02-24","1. A method of splitting hollow cellulosic fibers in a system for splitting the fibers, the method comprising the steps of: wetting the fibers; feeding the wet fibers to a gaseous flow; conducting the gaseous flow carrying the fibers surrounded by the gas through a throat of a venturi tube of the system; producing a drop in gaseous pressure in the throat of the venturi tube in order to cause a difference between a pressure inside of the fibers and a pressure of the gas outside of the fibers, and causing the fibers to split in a longitudinal direction, and to open a lumen inside the fibers.","D01B D21B D21C D21D D21H ","D01B:MECHANICAL TREATMENT OF NATURAL FIBROUS OR FILAMENTARY MATERIAL TO OBTAIN FIBRES OF FILAMENTS, e.g. FOR SPINNING (crude extraction of asbestos fibres from ores B03B; apparatus for retting D01C)
